        <p>SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company
            capable of returning a spacecraft from low Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in 2010. The company
            made history again in 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver
            cargo to and from the International Space Station.

            SpaceX successfully achieved the historic first reflight of an orbital class rocket in 2017, and the company
            now regularly launches flight-proven rockets. In 2018, SpaceX began launching Falcon Heavy, the worldâ€™s most
            powerful operational rocket by a factor of two.
